# 👋 Hi, I’m Michelle

I’m a **platform-minded Full-Stack Engineer** focused on building **scalable, production-ready systems** across modern web and cloud environments.

My work emphasizes **clean architecture, separation of concerns, and long-term maintainability** — systems designed to evolve as teams, products, and requirements grow.
